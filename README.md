# Student Performance Indicator 🎓📊

Welcome to the **Student Performance Indicator** project! This tool leverages the power of data science and machine learning to analyze student data and predict their performance. It aims to assist educators in identifying areas where students might need support and make data-driven decisions.

---

## 📝 Project Description

The **Student Performance Indicator** provides insights into students' academic performance based on various features like attendance, test scores, assignments, and more. This project uses machine learning models to classify students into categories such as "Excellent," "Good," "Average," and "Needs Improvement."

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numeric data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends, correlations, and distributions in the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Implements model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- **Prediction Pipeline**: Allows real-time predictions for new student data.
